# Project Title: Day Marker PWA

Answers the question: “ what day is it? ( what am i doing today ) “

Summary: A progressive web application designed as a dashboard for my daily activities.  At a glance, this tool will me where to go, at what time to get ready and at what time to leave, depending on the time of day and local traffic status.

Motivation: To not be late to things. 

Screenshots?

Tech Stack: Will use Next.js/Tailwind as a PWA hosted on Vercel. 
    start with the vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-boilerplate
    last, add on webpack workbox for pwa
  
(you can run several commands:
 $ npm run dev
    Starts the development server.
 $ npm run build
    Builds the app for production.
 $ npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.)

Design Alternatives:
  + Angular PWA
  + Preact-cli
  + Polymer
  + Svelt PWA
  + vercel-labs/next-on-the-edge


Complications:
  The first attempt was to use React + Babel + Webpack to get a working site. As it is not optimized for 'edge computing', I decided to pivot to a Next.js based example template optimized for Vercel.


Experiments?

Logging:
  Possibly recording previous week's trips?

Accessibility?

References to other works?
