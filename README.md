# Project Title: Day Marker PWA

Answers the question: “ what day is it? ( what am i doing today ) “

Summary: A progressive web application designed as a dashboard for my daily activities.  At a glance, this tool will me where to go, at what time to get ready and at what time to leave, depending on the time of day and local traffic status.

Motivation: To not be late to things. 

Screenshots?

Tech Stack: Will use Next.js/Tailwind as a PWA hosted on Vercel. 

Design Alternatives:
  + Angular PWA
  + Preact-cli
  + Polymer
  + Svelt PWA

Complications:
  The first attempt was to use React + Babel + Webpack to get a working site. As it is not optimized for 'edge computing', I decided to pivot to a Next.js based example template optimized for Vercel.

Experiments?

Logging:
  Possibly recording previous week's trips?

Accessibility?

References to other works?
